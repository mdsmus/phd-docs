** Look at awarded thesis. How they do?
** Hypothesis:
   Musical contour relations theories can be affected by the
   consistency problem in prime form algorithm and Contour segment
   classes table developed by Marvin and Laprade (1987).
** Thesis structure
   - Introduction
   - Literature review (compare theories and probe the state of art)
   - The software presentation
   - Discussion about how the software helps to solve the problem
   - Possible solutions for the presented problems.
